				<p class="p-first">The final portion of my investigation into Nihilism was a booklet that tied together work from the previous two projects. The essay “The Myth of Sisyphus” by Albert Camus forms the basis for the booklet and the images shown are of the camera setups I used to create the <span class="p-italic">Breaking Bad</span> opening. Camus’ essay compares our daily lives to the labours of Sisyphus, a man who was condemned to repeatedly push a stone up a mountainside and watch it roll back down for eternity. Camus makes the case that while Sisyphus cannot change his situation, it is within his power to acknowledge it and find joy in his decision to participate. In a way, the cameras in my photos can be seen as Sisyphus’ rock, and highlighting them in bright pink suggests the joy that can be found in the day-to-day. This, therefore, is a way to work through Nihilism, as suggested by both Camus and Nietzsche: after one rejects all systems of meaning, one is free to determine meaning for oneself.
